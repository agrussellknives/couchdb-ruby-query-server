# CouchDB Ruby Query Server

by Matthew Lyon <matt@flowerpowered.com>

This is a ruby version of the CouchDB Query server. It will let you write your map and reduce functions in ruby (instead of javascript, erlang, or what have you) and eventually all your couchapp functions as well (update, validation, show, list, filter).

It is still very much a work in progress, please don't use it for anything in production quite yet.
